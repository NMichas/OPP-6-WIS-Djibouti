This repository contains documentation as well as different Proof of Concept implementations for OPP6.

## High-level flow diagram
Presents a bird's eye view of the operations and basic data-flows envisaged for OPP-6. The main actors and actions are 
identified as well as the main building blocks of the system. We are using draw.io to maintain the [high-level flow diagram](https://www.draw.io/#HNMichas%2FOPP-6-WIS-Djibouti%2Fmaster%2Fdocs%2FOPP6-Flow-diagram.xml).

An exported version of the diagram in PNG is available next (note, this is manually exported, so it may not reflect the latest version of the diagram):
